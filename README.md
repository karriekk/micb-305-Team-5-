# Jan 22 Team Meeting Agenda
## 1. Look through the literature (i.e., Google Scholar or similar) to see what’s been previously done

### Research question 1: Are specific co-abundance groups (CAGs) more strongly associated with central adiposity (waist circumference) than with BMI? (Columbia dataset)
- Study conducted using subjects with an European origin, and researchers found that BMI is strongly correlated with measures of central adiposity, fat distribution, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2047-6310.2014.218.x)
- Study that investigated the relationship between gut microbiome and visceral fat accumulation (VFA), where researchers found that among other obese parameters such as waist, hipline, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and BMI, VFA has the largest number of correlation with microbial species. It also pointed out that BMI can only evaluate total body fat, but not fat distribution. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.09.026)
  - This is a bit similar to our research question, except that one of the independent variables we are interested in exploring is central adiposity instead of visceral fat. However, I am not sure how different the result would be. 
    - Central adiposity: broad term for fat around the abdomen, encompassing both the fat just under the skin (subcutaneous) and the deeper, more harmful fat surrounding organs (visceral fat)
