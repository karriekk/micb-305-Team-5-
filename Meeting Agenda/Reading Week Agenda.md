## Question
1. For most of the dietary antioxidants, we did not find any significant difference in alpha/beta diversity or taxa composition of gut microbiome between high-intake and low-intake PD cohorts.
   - We were wondering how we should address this issue.
   - Seems a bit weird because these findings do not seem to align with the literature findings, where the authors argued that dietary antioxidants can modulate gut microbiome composition.
