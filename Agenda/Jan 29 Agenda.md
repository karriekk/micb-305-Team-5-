# Jan 29 Team Meeting Agenda

### To do
1. Read up on the topic
2. Start collecting helpful papers
3. Determine the exact analytical groups and overall comparisons (group X vs Y)
4. Brainstorm potential limitations/issues of the project

### Literature Review Notes
1. Antioxidant Metabolism Pathways in Vitamins, Polyphenols, and Selenium: Parallels and Divergences (link: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25052600)
   - Explores the different metabolism pathways utilized by different antioxidants and factor sthat limit their bioavailability.
3. Role of Antioxidants in Modulating the Microbiota–Gut–Brain Axis and Their Impact on Neurodegenerative Diseases (link: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26083658)
   - The review explores the role of antioxidants in modulating the gut microbiota and their therapeutic potential in the context of gut-brain axis.
     - Highlight the impact of antioxidants on the gut microbial composition, reduction in oxidative stress, and modulation of key molecular pathways associated with neurodegeneration.
   - The review argues that antioxidants can modulate gut microbiome compositon to reduce oxidative stress by promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria that are capable of fermenting dietary fibers and produce beneficial metabolites such as SCFAs, which are critical in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the gut.
3. Regulation of gut microbiota by vitamin C, vitamin E and β-carotene (link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2023.112749)
   - Also a review paper that talks about the role of various antioxidants on microbial composition in the gut.
5. Dietary Antioxidants and Parkinson's Disease (link: https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9070570)
   - Talks about the cellular and genetic factors that result in the increase of oxidative stress in PD patients.
   - Also talks about the neuroprotective roles of dietary antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, selenium, and polyphenols along with their potential mechanisms to alleiviate PD pathology.
   - The authors claimed that the efficacy of nutritional intervention and dietary prevention of PD remains controversial. 
6. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8533511/#sec8-antioxidants-10-01563
   - Mainly focus on how to synthesize the antioxidants (contain the catabolic pathway genome) 

### Questions 
1. How many antioxidants do you think we should start focusing on?
2. Based on other paper and known metabolism pathways (any sugggestions on how to find the specific metabolism?)

### Potential limitations/issues of the project
1. What if the antioxidants (those in the metadata) can exert their biological effects and functions without requiring metabolism by the gut microbiome?
   - This is a potential issue associated with our project because we want to explore if the effect of dietary antioxidants on cognition in PD depend on whether a patient's gut microbiome is fully capable of metabolizing those antioxidants.
