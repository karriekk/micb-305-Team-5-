# Jan 15 First meeting note
## Highlight: What the profs think are feasible


### Columbian datasets #10 Question:
### 1. Are specific co-abundance groups (CAGs) more strongly associated with central adiposity (waist circumference) than with BMI? 
2. Does the type of dietary fat (saturated vs unsaturated) differentially associate with “healthy” vs “pathogenic” CAGs in Colombians? (not as novel, seems to have a lot of discovery)

#### Feedback on ideas:
- For the second research question:
  - Difficulties in determining what count as pathogenic bacteria within the dataset as microbes may or may not act pathogenic in certain environments (could use functional analysis that looks at pathogenicity)
  - Determine what's pathogenic and if they're increased/decreased


### Parkinson datasets #3 Question:

#### Feedback on ideas:
- Antioxidants Nutriens
  - Break into high and low scores (cognition scores)
- Antibiotic question is dependent on novelty
  - Need more refining on question
- Non dietary factors - alcohol
- Parkinsons vs other neurodegenerative disorders - most complicated, need to find new dataset that is due this week
  - Need to find specific niche
  - Might lack novelty

### Hispanic datasets #14 Question:

### 1. Are microbiome differences in Hispanic populations more strongly associated with obesity-related measures than with type 2 diabetes diagnosis itself?  

#### Feedback on ideas:
- Need to think about whether link them together or keep them separately
- Look at both cohort comparisons - which differences correlate more with obesity


### What to do for next week's meeting:
1. Set up a GitHub repository and cc everyone (including the instructor and TA) 
2. Meeting agenda should be posted before each meeting (Wednesday evening latest)
3. Google scholar data for each question (to determine novelty)
  - Use keywords for searches 
  - Keep it broad at first and narrow down results as we go
4. Look at metadata to determine what is usable
  - Ideally we have large groups with even results
  - Spread
  - Sample size
5. Narrow down the research questions to one
