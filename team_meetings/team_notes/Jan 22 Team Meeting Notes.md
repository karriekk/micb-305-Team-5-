# Research Question 1:
- Need to twist the research question a little bit to ensure that they do not overlap too much
- Chinese dataset is metagenomic instead of 16S (cannot be used, but can be referenced to make comparisons)
- Would be using columbia dataset to replicate chinese dataset procedure
  - Main outcome is fat metrics
  - Trying to find if columbia cohort behaves same/differently as chinese cohort
  - Good for discussion point
- Beta diversity measure - differential abundance
- Analysis throughout both in parallel 
  - Diversity metrics and co-abundance groups
    - Which ones trend together - piece groups together
    - Is one way more significant than the other


# Parkinson's dataset (only people with parkinson’s disease):
- Moca score (not a lot of variance but can look at people who start to experience cognitive decline)
  - Won’t really need control group of non pd patients
- Categorical comparison (most straightforward) -> random forest?
- What antioxidants to include
  - Identify through looking at preexisting literature to find most prominent antioxidants verified through prior research
- Find known antioxidant pathways is a good start
  - Could also use beta diversity analysis to determine which one is better from a group

# Diabetes Hispanic dataset(ruled out):
- Do some reading into other articles that look into these metrics
- Determine threshold for sample size scores
- Well defined in literature - easy to justify
- Unrealistic to take all measures and take microbiome analysis
  - Could bin people into high low groups (e.g., if a person has 5 high out of 7 → can be categorized as obese phenotype)
  - Or narrow down to only certain measures
- Hardest one 🙁

# If we end up choosing either of these, how would we refine the research questions
