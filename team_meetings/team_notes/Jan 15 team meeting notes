###Highlight: What the profs think are feasible


Columbian datasets #10 Question:
###Are specific co-abundance groups (CAGs) more strongly associated with central adiposity (waist circumference) than with BMI? 
###Does the type of dietary fat (saturated vs unsaturated) differentially associate with “healthy” vs “pathogenic” CAGs in Colombians? (not as novel, seems to have a lot of discovery)
Feedback on ideas:
Columbia dataset:
Difficulties in determining what count as pathogenic bacteria within the dataset
Microbe may or may not act pathogenic in certain environments
Could use functional analysis that looks at pathogenicity
Determine whats pathogenic and if theyre increased/decreased 
Obesity idea is easier to work with
Needs more literature search, Keywords for searches 
Keep it broad at first and narrow down results as we go

Parkinson datasets #3 Question:
Feedback on ideas:
Parkinson's dataset:
Antioxidants Nutriens
Break into high and low scores (cognition scores)
Antibiotic question is dependent on novelty
Need more refining on question
Non dietary factors - alcohol
Parkinsons vs other neurodegenerative disorders - most complicated, need to find new dataset that is due this week
Need to find specific niche
Might lack novelty

Hispanic datasets #14 Question:
Are microbiome differences in Hispanic populations more strongly associated with obesity-related measures than with type 2 diabetes diagnosis itself?  
need to think about whether link them together or separately  
Feedback on ideas:
Look at both cohort comparisons - which differences correlate more with obesity

What to do for next step:
Set up a GitHub repository and cc everyone (including the instructor and TA) 
Meeting agenda should be posted before each meeting (Wednesday evening latest)
Google scholar data for each question (to determine novelty)
Look at metadata to determine what is usable
Ideally we have large groups with even results
Spread
Sample size
Narrow down the research questions to one
