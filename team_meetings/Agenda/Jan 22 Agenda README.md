# Jan 22 Team Meeting Agenda
## 1. Look through the literature (i.e., Google Scholar or similar) to see what’s been previously done

### Research question 1: Are specific co-abundance groups (CAGs) more strongly associated with central adiposity (waist circumference) than with BMI? (Colombia dataset)
- Study conducted using subjects with an European origin, and researchers found that BMI is strongly correlated with measures of central adiposity, fat distribution, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2047-6310.2014.218.x)
- Study that investigated the relationship between gut microbiome and visceral fat accumulation (VFA), where researchers found that among other obese parameters such as waist (gauges both visceral fat and upper-body subcutaneous fat), hipline, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and BMI, VFA has the largest number of correlation with microbial species. It also pointed out that BMI can only evaluate total body fat, but not fat distribution. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.09.026)
  - This is a bit similar to our research question, except that one of the independent variables we are interested in exploring is central adiposity (broad term for fat around the abdomen, encompassing both the fat just under the skin (subcutaneous) and the deeper, more harmful fat surrounding organs (visceral fat)) instead of visceral fat, and that the above research focuses on the Chinese cohort, whereas the dataset we will be using focuses on the Colombia cohort.
    -  Some thoughts: maybe consider about doing a cross-comparison between these two cohorts and link the differences (if any) to other factors such as genetics, geographical factors, and diets? Not sure how feasible this would be though.
    -  Question: Is waist circumference the same as waist (which is what is measured as one of the obese parameters in a previous study)? 


## 2. Download the metadata and open it in Excel. What groups would you need to define for your project idea? How many samples would be in each group, and is that a feasible number for an analysis? (bare minimum = 3/group)

### Research question 1: Are specific co-abundance groups (CAGs) more strongly associated with central adiposity (waist circumference) than with BMI? (Columbia dataset)
- Variables of interest:
  - Co-abundance groups 
  - BMI (numeric value)
    - Can group individuals based on BMI to study co-abundance differece between different groups of individuals
      - In the metadata, it classifies individuals as "overweight", "obese" and "lean" based on BMI, each group has more than 3 samples.
  - Central adiposity/waist circumference (numeric value)
    - Can group individuals based on central adoposity to study co-abundance difference between different groups of individuals (need to define the standards that will be used to group individuals)
