Things that need to be done before the meeting:
Google scholar data for each question (to determine novelty)
Look at metadata to determine what is usable

Narrow down the research questions to one 


## Research question 1: Are specific co-abundance groups (CAGs) more strongly associated with central adiposity (waist circumferance) than with BMI?" using the Columbia dataset
