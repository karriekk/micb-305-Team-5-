Server has been down all week :((((  ;-;

### Update 2/11 7.40pm--> Server back again

### Rest of the week Plan: 
- To walk through module 13 and 14 to investigate our Aim # 1

### Meanwhile: writing introduction/background of the proposal section:
Introduction and Background:
- What is your topic, and why is it important to study it?
- What are the key terms and definitions that are necessary to understand your project? Include any key data classifications or binning (ex. turning ‘age’ into old/young  --> what age cutoff will you use, and why?).
Whose/what dataset are you using? What kind of samples are they, and how many are there? Where was the data collected?
- What is currently known? Include an overview of relevant papers, including the original research paper that published the dataset, any UJEMI(+) papers that used the dataset, and other literature that is relevant to your research question.
- Where reasonably possible, highlight common trends instead of listing results from individual papers. For example, if alpha diversity is increased in your condition across the majority of papers, state that instead of listing them out individually.

### Question:
- Do we have a meeting next week?
