# Jan 29 Team Meeting Agenda

### To do
1. Read up on the topic
2. Start collecting helpful papers
3. Determine the exact analytical groups and overall comparisons (group X vs Y)
4. Brainstorm potential limitations/issues of the project

### Literature Review Notes


### Questions 
1. How many antioxidants do you think we should start focusing on?
2. Based on other paper and known metabolic pathways (any sugggestions on how to find the specific metabolism?)

### Potential limitations/issues of the project
1. What if the antioxidants (those in the metadata) can exert their biological effects and functions without requiring metabolism by the gut microbiome?
   - This is a potential issue associated with our project because we want to explore if the effect of dietary antioxidants on cognition in PD depend on whether a patient's gut microbiome is fully capable of metabolizing those antioxidants.
