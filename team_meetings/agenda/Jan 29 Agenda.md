# To do
1. Read up on the topic
2. Start collecting helpful papers
3. Determine the exact analytical groups and overall comparisons (group X vs Y)
4. Brainstorm potential limitations/issues of the project

### Notes taken while reading literatures
1. Dietary Antioxidants and Parkinson's Disease (link: https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9070570)
- Vitamin C
  - "Despite the protective roles of vitamin C found in in vitro and animal models, the efficacy of vitamin C against PD in humans is still controversial. Blood samples collected from PD patients show increased lipid peroxidation coupled with significantly lower levels of vitamin C compared to healthy controls, but some studies have also reported negligible effects of vitamin C on PD in human subjects."
### Question: 
1. How many antioxidants do you think we should start focusing on?
2. Based on other paper and know the metabolism (any sugggestions on how to find the specific metabolism?)
