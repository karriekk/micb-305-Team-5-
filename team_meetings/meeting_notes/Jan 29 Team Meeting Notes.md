### Future direction on how to approach the question
- Start with one antioxidant (look through the metadata, how many people take that antioxidants)
  - There is no required specific requirement about how many antioxidants being included
- Look at metabolism, also dietary, bin them either high (a spread) or low or continuous
  - Bin by metabolized or not (high or low), then use each category to find correlation of diet and outcome
- Graph for each antioxidant (bar plot, what’s the consumption level of each of them)
  - Look at how these variables looking in these population
- Trying to make connections and conclusions between the dietary intake and the consumption score.
  - For example, if the PD group has high metabolic group but low consumption --> can make conclusion that the PD group needs to consume more

### Suggestions from Imogen
1. Choose the antiocidant(s) and normalize consumption against body weight or total food intake (kcal?)
   - Can transform this into some form of scoring
2. Choose the key antioxidant metabolism pathways based on the literature, focusing on the antioxidants we chose in (1).
   - For whole pathways, better sucess with MetaCyc than Kegg
3. Based on the PICRUSt analysis outcomes, categorize the pathway abundances.
   - E.g., high or low - do we split around the median value, or instead remove the "middle"?

### Suggestions from Avril:
##### Overall Goal:
To understand how dietart antioxidant intake shapes the gut microbiome and whether microbiome-mediated antioxidant metabolism is associated with cognitive outcomes.

##### Aim 1:
Determine how antioxidant intake is associated with gut microbiome composition and diversity. Specifically, we will assess how varing levels of antioxidant intake select for specific microbial taxa and examine corresponding changes in alpha and beta diversity.

##### Aim 2 (taxa analysis):
Identify gut microbial taxa that are differentially abundant across different levels of antioxidant intake.

##### Aim 3 (function analysis):
Characterize the functional capacity of the gut microbiome related to antioxidant metabolism.

##### Aim 4 (our original research question):
Evaluate whether the presence of microbial genes involved in antioxidant metabolism modifies the relationship between antioxidant intake and cognitive performance (e.g., if individuals lacking genes involved in antioxidant metabolism actually have a lower cognitive score than the ones who have the genes) to study gut microbiome are actually involved in alleviating the cognition decline associated with PD.
