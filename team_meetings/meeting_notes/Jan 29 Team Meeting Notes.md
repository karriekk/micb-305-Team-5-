### Future direction on how to approach the question
- start with one antioxidant (look through the metadata, how many people take that antioxidants)--> there is no required specific requirement about how many antioxidants being include
- look at metabolism, also dietary, bin them either high (a spread) or low or continuous
- graph for each antioxidant (bar plot, what’s the consumption level of each of them) --> look at how these variables looking in these population
- Trying to make connections and conclusions between the dietary intake and the consumption score.
 -For example, if the PD group has high metabolic group but low consumption→ can make conclusion that the PD group needs to consume more
