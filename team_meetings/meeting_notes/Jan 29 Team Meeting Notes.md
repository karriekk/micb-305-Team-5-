### Future direction on how to approach the question
- Start with one antioxidant (look through the metadata, how many people take that antioxidants)
  - There is no required specific requirement about how many antioxidants being included
- Look at metabolism, also dietary, bin them either high (a spread) or low or continuous
  - Bin by metabolized or not (high or low), then use each category to find correlation of diet and outcome
- Graph for each antioxidant (bar plot, what’s the consumption level of each of them)
  - Look at how these variables looking in these population
- Trying to make connections and conclusions between the dietary intake and the consumption score.
  - For example, if the PD group has high metabolic group but low consumption --> can make conclusion that the PD group needs to consume more

### Suggestion from Imogen
1. Choose the antiocidant(s) and normalize consumption against body weight or total food intake (kcal?)
   - Can transform this into some form of scoring
2. Choose the key antioxidant metabolism pathways based on the literature, focusing on the antioxidants we chose in (1).
   - For whole pathways, better sucess with MetaCyc than Kegg
3. Based on the PICRUSt analysis outcomes, categorize the pathway abundances.
   - E.g., high or low - do we split around the median value, or instead remove the "middle"?
